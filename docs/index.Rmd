## Covid Report
I write a paragraph here. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. The trends of cumulative cases are increasing at a somewhat of a linear rate. 
  

I also want to show the chart:  
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
